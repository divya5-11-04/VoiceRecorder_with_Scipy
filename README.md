import sounddevice
from scipy.io.wavfile import write
```
- **`import sounddevice`**: This imports the `sounddevice` library, which allows Python to record and play audio from your microphone.
- **`from scipy.io.wavfile import write`**: This imports the `write` function from `scipy.io.wavfile`, which is used to save recorded audio in WAV format.

```
def divyavoice_recorder(seconds, file):
```
- **`def divyavoice_recorder(seconds, file):`**: Defines a function named `divyavoice_recorder` that takes two arguments: 
  - `seconds`: the duration of the recording (in seconds),
  - `file`: the name of the file where the recording will be saved.
'''
    print("Recording Started.....")
'''
- **`print("Recording Started.....")`**: Displays a message indicating that the recording has begun.
'''

    divyarecording = sounddevice.rec((seconds * 44100), samplerate=44100, channels=2)
'''
- **`divyarecording = sounddevice.rec((seconds * 44100), samplerate=44100, channels=2)`**: 
  - This line records audio using the `sounddevice.rec()` function.
  - The recording duration is `seconds * 44100` (44100 samples per second is the standard sample rate for audio, so multiplying it by the number of seconds gives the total number of samples).
  - `samplerate=44100` specifies the audio sample rate (44100 Hz).
  - `channels=2` sets the audio to stereo (2 channels).

```
    sounddevice.wait()
```
- **`sounddevice.wait()`**: This line pauses the execution until the recording is finished. It waits for the recording to complete before moving on.

```
    write(file, 44100, divyarecording)
```
- **`write(file, 44100, divyarecording)`**: 
  - This uses the `write()` function from `scipy.io.wavfile` to save the recorded audio.
  - `file`: the filename (e.g., `"recordsave.wav"`).
  - `44100`: the sample rate of the recording (same as the recording rate).
  - `divyarecording`: the recorded audio data to be saved.

```
    print("Recording is finished")
```
- **`print("Recording is finished")`**: Displays a message indicating that the recording has been completed.
'''

In summary, this function records audio for a specified number of seconds and saves it as a WAV file, with messages displayed before and after the recording.
